				<h3>Communication and Relationships</h3>
				<p>Within the last few months, I confronted a friend about how I thought she was treating me different. She responded that she had felt that nothing changed on her part but she had similar feelings about me. I that was the case, I explained to her I thought that I might have been bothering her, and consequently I made an effort to back off so that I wouldn’t be stepping on her toes. She proceeded to ask me a fair question, “why didn’t I just ask?” She then asked me how she seemed different to me, which I replied with a list of concerns that I’ve noticed over the past month. </p>
				<p>She dismissed my claims and went on to tell me that she doesn’t know what it could have been. She apologized for not being able to see me again after the goodbye dinner my friends had for me before I moved back to California. I thought this was a strange response, and asked her to try to put herself in my place as a way to see my perspective. I said, </p>
				<span><p>“If you were leaving the state for an indefinite period of time and someone who you view as one of your closest friends put an hour aside to go to a going away party with at least ten other friends there as the last time you’d see them, you wouldn’t think that is odd?”</p></span>
				<p>After I asked her this, the truth came out. She replied that she had heard from someone that I had romantic feelings for her and she didn’t want to make it awkward for me because naturally, she didn’t have those same feelings for me.  </p>
				<p>After thinking about her response for sometime, I was very surprised. In my response to her, I admitted that at one time I was attracted to her, but never enough to actually communicate those feelings, so I moved on. I followed up with a few questions:</p>
				<span><p>“When I asked you if anything had changed between us, and you said no, but now you tell me things have, what should I make of this? Earlier you also asked me why I didn’t just ask you if something was bothering you instead of assuming there was, why didn’t you do the same and confront me? And if I originally were to ask, would you have told me that nothing’s wrong, like you did earlier?”</p></span>
				<p>I felt these were very valid questions and were articulated very respectfully. She dismissed my concerns and told me she doesn’t know what I want from her and that she doesn’t want to continue talking about something she or I should have said.  “It’s done with so lets just move forward,” was the impression she was under. </p>
				<p>I was amazed that she lied to me, and then held me to a different standard than she treated me with, and then continued to avoid any kind of responsibility by dismissing it as something that we couldn’t change, as if it had zero potential to have any bearing on our future relationship. I was shocked at the lack of empathy she showed me. </p>
				<p>I learned a lot about what I value in any relationship. Being treated by someone the same as how they would expect you to treat them is the most reasonable expectation I could ever place on any relationship in my life. I can’t afford to surround myself with people that hold double standards. It’s not good for either party and I will not tolerate it. I don’t expect perfection; we all make mistakes and I am no exception, but taking responsibility for those mistakes is the first step in working to not repeat them. </p>

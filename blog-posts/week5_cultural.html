				<h3>Peer Pairing</h3>
				<p>Before DBC, peer pairing was something I had never thought about. Starting Phase 0, I quickly learned the important role it plays in not only learning to code, but also creating really great code. I enjoy working with people on projects, but I’ve never worked on something so difficult for each other. To make matters worse, we were pairing over Google Hangouts and not next to one another, adding another layer of difficulty in communication. </p>
				<p>The feelings I have while pairing are the same as when I’m attempting to the exercises by myself, mostly frustration. It’s very difficult for me to communicate my ideas because of the lack of basic knowledge I have for the disciplines that make up web development. When explaining, I often catch myself going into long pauses trying to think of the name of some sort of data structure I’m thinking of. If I’m not mixing up keys and values of a hash, I’m calling the elements within an array ‘arguments.’ I do think these are minor frustrations that will ultimately subside as I continue learning. </p>
				<p>Pairing with other people who are at a similar level has been really great. I find that everyone I’ve paired with tends to know more than me or at least are much better at communicating than me. I really appreciate their patience, even being there and being able to watch how they tackle a problem is very helpful. I enjoy learning from additional perspectives. </p>
				<p>After each pairing session, each of us at DBC are expected to give feedback to the person we paired with. Feedback is supposed to be Actionable, Specific, and Kind. Feedback needs to be actionable in order to be useful. If someone is bothered by the color of my eyes and proceeds to write that in their feedback, there’s not much I can do about that. Consequently, in order for feedback to be useful, it needs to be at least in the control of the person receiving the feedback. Feedback needs to be specific; if I were to give someone feedback that tells him or her that they need to be nicer without any concrete examples, it’s hard to expect that person to change. This person would be wondering what they could have done to seem not nice. Finally, feedback needs to be kind. By kind, I don’t mean fake; I mean that when giving feedback, you need to be empathetic and think about how if you were this person, how you would want the feedback to be given to you. </p>
				<p>Writing useful feedback is hard; I will admit that I’m not good at it. I rarely find any issue with any of the people I pair with. We get the exercise done and I learn a lot in the process. As far as I’m concerned, all of my pairing sessions have been a success.  Reading feedback given to me has been a good experience. I have definitely been mindful of the recommendations given to me. A common theme for feedback that I receive is my partners are often wondering what I’m thinking. In pairing sessions after, I’ve been more assertive in asking questions when I’m confused and also being open in what I’m thinking, even if it tends to be mostly nonsense. </p>
				<p>Overall, peer pairing has been hugely helpful and using feedback to guide my learning has only helped. </p>
